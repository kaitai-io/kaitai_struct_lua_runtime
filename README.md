# Kaitai Struct: runtime library for Lua

This library implements Kaitai Struct API for Lua 5.3.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used for describe various binary
data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary file
formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

## Installation

1. You can clone the runtime library with Git:

   <pre><code>git clone <strong>--recurse-submodules</strong> https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_lua_runtime.git</code></pre>

   If you clone without `--recurse-submodules`, the runtime library will work too, but you'll not be able to parse formats that use `process: zlib` - calling `KaitaiStream.process_zlib` will fail. If you need _zlib_ support but the runtime was cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Or if you want to add the runtime library to your project as a Git submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_lua_runtime.git [<path>]
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

   The second command is only required if you need support for `process: zlib`.
